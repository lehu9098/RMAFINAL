        <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="ma-2">COVID-19 Policy for Guide Trips</h2>
        <p>
          As a mostly outdoor activity, we’ve found that guided
  trips are very doable during the COVID-19 pandemic as long as communication happens
  between guides and clients. To maintain appropriate social distancing, we’ve seen many
  clients choosing to follow guides to the fishing destination separately in their own vehicles.
  While this is not required, we encourage clients to communicate their preferences as far as
  this is concerned with their guides ahead of time, and clients should expect guides to do the
  same. We do require face coverings at all times inside of the fly shop when handling any
  pre-trip tasks like fitting for boots and waders, buying licenses, settling up on final trip
  payment, and so on. Face coverings, such as buffs and sun masks, are highly encouraged
  when on the water fishing during a guided trip. As a preventive measure, we are also fully
  sanitizing all boots, waders, rods, reels, and other rental gear after each guide trip. Please
  do not book or come to a guide trip if you are experiencing symptoms and/or have come in
  contact with someone who has been exposed to COVID-19.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="ma-2">What a Trip Looks Like</h2>
        <p>
          We consider ourselves the most beginner-friendly fly shop on the
  planet for a reason: we expect our guides to be both skilled anglers and patient teachers,
  with the latter being possibly even more important. Regardless of skill level, our guides are
  prepared to tailor a trip appropriately. Beginners can expect a trip to start with a brief
  casting lesson and some practice, as well as a little bit on how to read and approach a trout
  stream. More experienced anglers should be sure to discuss with their guide ahead of time
  what their goals are for a trip. Whether you’re looking for an intensive lesson on fishing
  tiny midges in the wintertime or you’re a beginner looking to catch your first few trout in
  the summer, we can make it happen!

        <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="ma-2">What’s Included (What do I get?)</h2>
        <p>
          Half-day trips do not include lunch, but guides
generally come prepared with a cooler containing ice and some waters, and guides will
sometimes also have snacks. Full-day trips do include lunch from a local deli, Dish Gourmet,
at no extra cost (can also be tacked onto a half day trip at $15 per meal). All guided trips
include rental of any fishing gear needed for all clients, including a rod, reel, boots, and
waders, and guides will provide all necessary flies and terminal tackle, as needed. Clients
can expect guides to tie all knots and assist with rigging of any equipment during a trip. The
only costs to anticipate that are not included in our trip fees are the price of a state-issued
fishing license – available ahead of time online or before the trip at the shop – and the
Rocky Mountain National Park entry fee, as applicable. For details on park entry fees and
passes, see: https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm under the “Info” tab. Please also see the
bottom of this page for a note on guide gratuities.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="ma-2">Client/Guide Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          No matter the trip, our goal as guides is always to make sure
that clients have some fun and come away with the skills needed to catch trout
independently on their own. For clients, the key to a successful trip is often communicating
to their guide what they’re looking for in a full or half-day of fishing. For our guides,
expectations are: we teach catch-and-release fishing, often with barbless hooks when in
Rocky Mountain National Park. We do not offer bait-fishing trips, including ice-fishing trips,
and we do not kill and keep fish on trips. When in Rocky Mountain National Park, we also
do not allow consumption of alcohol, marijuana, or tobacco, per park regulations.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="ma-2">Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Above all else, we look to give clients a safe and enjoyable experience on the water.
That said, there is always a possibility of unforeseen circumstances happening, so we
require all of our guides to be CPR and First Aid certified. Please let us know ahead of time
about any medical or dietary needs, including allergies, and about any clients who may be
more mobility-challenged. Weather conditions in Colorado are always highly variable,
especially at the 9,000 – 11,000 foot altitude in RMNP, so guides are always prepared to
adapt based on changing weather conditions. If you’re concerned about weather ahead of a
trip, don’t hesitate to give your guide or the shop a call to discuss.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="ma-2">Gratuities</h2>
        <p>
          Tipping your guide is customary in the outdoor industry and tends to follow
usual service industry guidelines. Guides provide everything from the trip out of their own
pocket, including beverages, snacks, basic fishing supplies including all flies, and gas for
transit. Tips are most often handled after the trip in cash, but we can also run a tip in the
shop as a credit card transaction if preferred. About 20 percent of the overall trip cost is a
standard baseline for tipping, though the exact amount is obviously always at client
discretion. If you feel your expectations haven’t been met on a trip, please let your guide
and the shop know.
