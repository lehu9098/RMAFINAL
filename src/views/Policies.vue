        <p>
          Like all businesses during the covid-19 pandemic, we’ve had to adjust many
    of our practices to ensure the safety of our customers, clients, and employees. Face
    coverings are mandatory inside of the shop, and we’re happy to accommodate call-in
    orders and curbside pick-up. We’re also regularly disinfecting surfaces, providing optional
    gloves for shopping, and we have free face masks available for shoppers, as needed. We’ve
    scaled back many of our usual events involving group gatherings, like Bugs ‘n Brews, larger
    group classes, and so on, but we’re excited to be still offering some events as we head into
    2021. Our Intro to Fly Fishing classes have also been successfully run throughout the
    season with group sizes not exceeding 6 and the classes being held outdoors with
    appropriate PPE and spacing. Our Fish-Alongs have been postponed until further notice as
    have all fly tying classes.
